# Basic usage to draw a point.

# Concerning the color convertion, and grayscale, the functions
# of uctk.roi are similare to uctk.print
# Indeed, by default, we expect you to work with opencv color image,
# .i.e BGR images.
# But if you load from matplotlib (or other) you can convert before printing.
# If you don't, the channels will be wrongly displayed

# So here is how to convert.

# Of course, grayscale / single channel is handled

# If you have noted in the napari, we split the channels of the color image.
# So that you can they display/hide each channel separatly.
# The drawback is that the viewer takes more time to appear,
# and it flickers a bit.
# But you can disable this splitting. See below.
